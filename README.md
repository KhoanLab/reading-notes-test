My Reading Notes!

This is where I'm going to put my reading assignments.

Growth mindset is my own perception of my abilities. I can keep  improving with determination, persevenrence, practice, etc.

Reminders to stay in a growth mindset: 
- Remember if it's hard,
- Sucking at something's the first step to being sorta good at something
- Put your mask on first, you can't help others if you don't take care of yourself.
- whenerver i'm struggling, remmeber no one else is walking in my shoes. this is my journey!
- Try to focus on what's possible, not excuses. we can always find reasons why NOT, but it'll be helpful to find reasons why YES!
